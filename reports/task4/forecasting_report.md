# Task 4: Forecasting Report
## Ethiopia Financial Inclusion Forecasts 2025-2027

### Executive Summary
Forecasts for Ethiopia's financial inclusion indicators show continued growth in account ownership and digital payment usage, though at a slower pace than historical rates. The base scenario suggests Ethiopia may fall short of the NFIS-II target of 60% financial inclusion by 2027.

### Key Forecasts

#### Account Ownership (ACCESS)
| Year | Base Forecast | 95% Confidence Interval | Optimistic | Pessimistic | NFIS-II Target |
|------|---------------|-------------------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| 2025 | 36.0% | 22.7%-49.3% | 43.2% | 28.8% | N/A |
| 2026 | 36.3% | 23.0%-49.6% | 43.6% | 29.1% | N/A |
| 2027 | 36.7% | 23.4%-50.0% | 44.1% | 29.4% | 60.0% |


#### Digital Payment Usage (USAGE)
| Year | Base Forecast | 95% Confidence Interval | Optimistic | Pessimistic |
|------|---------------|-------------------------|------------|-------------|


### Methodology
1. **Baseline Trend**: Linear projection of historical growth rates
2. **Event Augmentation**: Added impacts from known and anticipated market events
3. **Scenario Analysis**: Developed optimistic, base, and pessimistic scenarios
4. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Confidence intervals and Monte Carlo simulation

### Key Findings
1. **Growth Deceleration**: Account ownership growth slows to 4.7 pp/year (2024-2027) vs historical rates
2. **NFIS-II Target Gap**: Base forecast falls short by 23.3 percentage points in 2027
3. **Event Sensitivity**: Future policy implementations could alter trajectory by ±nan%

### Uncertainty Assessment
- **Primary Source**: Data sparsity (only 5 data points since 2011)
- **Confidence**: Moderate for base scenario, low for extreme scenarios
- **Range**: 2027 forecasts range from 29.4% to 44.1% across scenarios

### Recommendations
1. **Accelerate Rural Penetration**: Future growth depends on underserved populations
2. **Enhance Monitoring**: Implement quarterly inclusion metrics tracking
3. **Public-Private Coordination**: Align infrastructure investments with inclusion goals
4. **Digital Literacy Focus**: Bridge usage gap through skills development
