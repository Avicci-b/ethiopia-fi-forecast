# Key Insights from Exploratory Data Analysis
## Ethiopia Financial Inclusion Forecasting

### 1. ACCESS Growth Shows Significant Slowdown
**Evidence**: Account ownership grew only +3 percentage points (46% → 49%) from 2021-2024, compared to +11pp (35% → 46%) from 2017-2021.
**Implication**: Urban markets may be approaching saturation, requiring focus on rural penetration.

### 2. Mobile Money Paradox: Registered vs. Active Users
**Evidence**: 65M+ mobile money accounts registered but only 9.45% of adults report mobile money ownership in 2024 Findex.
**Implication**: High registration doesn't equal usage; focus should shift from sign-ups to active usage.

### 3. Strong Infrastructure-Inclusion Correlation
**Evidence**: Correlation coefficient of ~0.85 between mobile penetration and account ownership rates.
**Implication**: Infrastructure investments (4G, smartphones, agents) are reliable leading indicators for inclusion gains.

### 4. Event Impacts Show Clear Temporal Patterns
**Evidence**: Telebirr launch (2021) preceded mobile money user growth from 4.7% to 9.45% over 3 years.
**Implication**: Product launches have measurable impacts with 6-24 month lags that can be modeled.

### 5. Urban-Rural Divide Persists
**Evidence**: Infrastructure indicators (4G coverage, agent density) show concentrated growth in urban centers.
**Implication**: Closing inclusion gaps requires targeted rural infrastructure investments.

### 6. Gender Gap Remains Stubborn
**Evidence**: Despite policy interventions, gender gap in account ownership persists with limited improvement.
**Implication**: Gender-specific interventions needed beyond general inclusion policies.

### 7. Usage-Access Gap Limits Impact
**Evidence**: While 49% have accounts, only ~35% make/receive digital payments regularly.
**Implication**: Focus should shift from account opening to payment use cases (P2P, merchant, bills).

### 8. Data Sparsity Challenges Analysis
**Evidence**: Only 5 data points for key ACCESS indicator (2011, 2014, 2017, 2021, 2024).
**Implication**: Need proxy indicators and sophisticated time series methods for forecasting.
